#The whole matrix is filled with zeros now. You can assume that it's updated automatically using special hardware agents.
# The thing you have to do is to wait for the matrix to be filled with measurements.

#Now it's time to determine the monthly average noon temperature. Add up all 31 readings recorded at noon and divide the
# sum by 31. You can assume that the midnight temperature is stored first. Here's the relevant code:

# the matrix is magically updated here

#
# the matrix is magically updated here
#

highest = -100.0

for day in temps:

# the matrix is magically updated here
